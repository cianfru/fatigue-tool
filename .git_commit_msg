Fix: Generate post-duty sleep after night flights at hotel layovers

Problem:
- No sleep generated after duties ending at hotel layovers
- Pilots arriving at hotels had no recovery sleep calculated
- Led to inaccurate fatigue predictions and unrealistic sleep debt

Root Cause:
- Inverted logic in _generate_post_duty_sleep() environment detection
- Condition checked if next duty departs from DIFFERENT location (wrong)
- Should check if next duty departs from SAME location (layover)

Solution:
1. Fixed environment detection logic to correctly identify hotel layovers
2. Added post-duty sleep to API response (sleep_strategies dictionary)
3. Changed sleep times to display in actual location timezone (not home TZ)
4. Added location_timezone and environment metadata to API response

Changes:
- core_model.py: Fixed _generate_post_duty_sleep() logic
- core_model.py: Added post-duty sleep to API exposure
- core_model.py: Changed timezone display to use location TZ
- Added 4 comprehensive test files

Impact:
- Post-duty hotel sleep now correctly generated and visible in API
- Sleep times shown in pilot's actual location timezone
- More accurate fatigue predictions for multi-day trips with layovers
- EASA-compliant rest period modeling

Tests:
All tests passing - post-duty sleep correctly generated and exposed in API
